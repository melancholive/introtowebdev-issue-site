== Building a 3 Page Website about an Issue ==

Create a three page website about an "issue" you care about. Let this be something in the world, society, a community, or your life that will guide you to think about how to organize and present your perspective or educate your visitors in a coherent way. Your approach to this could be educational, personal, promoting a specific resource or organization.

- Sketching your mockup or "wireframe" to think about a project as a whole
- Using DIVs to structure the layout of your site, making use of `display`, and `position` to bring your wireframe to life.
- Come up with a coherent way to navigate the three sections of your page, depending on your overall design goal.

- Present your topic in a way that effectively communicates a perspective, or some educational insight into the issue you chose.
  - This could mean designing in a way that is very specific, informational, editorial, design oriented, or...
  - if you choose to pursue something more abstract, satirical, visual... think about how you can push those choices in a way that is most effecting to your viewer, or communicative of your perspective.

- When establishing the "design language" of your site through the specific choice of fonts, colors, spacing, and content:
  - Think about the ways you are employing Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity to best effect.
