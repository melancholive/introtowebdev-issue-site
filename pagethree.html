		<p class="titletext">SINOPHOBIA IN MEDIA</p>
		<p class="fullblock">The Korean and Japanese language have become “aesthetic,” which is also another topic to discuss, but the Chinese language continues to be mocked by the west. People continue to mispronounce words for their own amusement. John Cena’s video “bingchilling” mispronunciation turned from an innocent meme to another form of mocking the language. When confronted by others for their sinophobia, netizens instead use the “it’s just a joke” argument, they refuse to acknowledge their wrongs and instead blame others for being too sensitive. Similar phenomenons apply to both "Super Idol" and "Shui Hua Piao Piao."</p>

				<p class="titletext">REBRANDING OF CHINESE MEDIA</p>
				<p>Despite the massive success of Genshin Impact, sinophobia has continued to plague internet culture. Aware of the impression China has on people, Hoyoverse, the creators of Genshin Impact, have gone as far as branding their game using the Japanese pronunciation, rather than the Chinese one, Yuan Shen. Other companies such as Miniso and Genki Forest have done the same in the past. This rebranding of Chinese media has extended past these corporations seeking to maximize their profits, but to social media, especially in beauty. Douyin makeup trends, the Chinese version of TikTok, are often reposted on TikTok for easy views. However, manhua lashes became manga lashes, and douyin and xiaohongshu makeup became “soft Korean” makeup. </p>

				<p class="titletext">DIFFERENCE IN CULTURAL POLICIES</p>
				<p class="fullblock">South Korea and Japan have both adopted cultural policies to promote their cultural products and appeal to a global audience, while China has not done so to the same extent. While China has made significant strides in developing its cultural industries, such as its booming film and television industry, it has not focused as heavily on promoting these products to an international audience. Additionally, China's government has been more restrictive of its cultural exports, with policies such as the "Great Firewall" and the banning of certain foreign cultural products, which can limit the country's soft power and cultural influence.</p>
