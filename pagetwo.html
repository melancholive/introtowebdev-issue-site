				<p class="titletext">ASIAN FISHING ON TIKTOK</p>
				<p>"Asian fishing" is a form of cultural appropriation that involves individuals portraying themselves as Asian, often through the use of makeup or filters, when they are not actually of Asian descent. This behavior can be harmful in many ways. It can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and promote the fetishization of Asian cultures, which can contribute to racism, discrimination, and the dehumanization of Asian people. It can also make it difficult for individuals of Asian descent to be taken seriously or be seen as authentic when they are, in fact, Asian.</p>

				<p class="titletext">THE ANIME WAIFU ACCENT & "UWU" VOICE</p>
				<p>The anime waifu accent and the associated "uwu" voice have been criticized for their potential to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and cultural appropriation. he anime waifu accent is based on a stereotypical portrayal of East Asian women as cute, innocent, and submissive. The "uwu" voice, which is often used in conjunction with the anime waifu accent, can also be seen as infantilizing and objectifying. This voice is typically high-pitched and childlike, which can create a sense of vulnerability or helplessness that can be appealing to some audiences. </p>
				<p>This portrayal can be harmful because it perpetuates a one-dimensional and inaccurate representation of an entire group of people. Additionally, it can contribute to the fetishization of East Asian women, which can have real-world consequences for their safety and well-being. It is not a natural or authentic way of speaking for most East Asian people, but rather a performance style that is based on anime and manga. Adopting this style of speaking without any connection to the cultural context that produced it can be seen as a form of cultural appropriation, which can be disrespectful and offensive to people from that culture. Although there many whose voice naturally sound high pitched such as LilyPichu and Ironmouse.</p>
