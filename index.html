				<p>East Asian entertainment used to be a niche market that mainly appealed to a small group of fans, both locally and internationally. Enjoying these forms of entertainment was often seen as isolating due to the negative stereotypes associated with being a fan of the media. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the entertainment industry, with many people around the world spending more time at home and turning to various forms of media for entertainment, resulting in increased interest in Asian entertainment, including movies, TV shows, music, and video games.</p>
